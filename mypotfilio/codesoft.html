           This internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience in Python, 
           allowing me to strengthen my foundational knowledge and apply it to real-world tasks
            and projects.Throughout the internship, 
            I actively worked on multiple Python-based projects that 
            helped me enhance my programming skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving 
            abilities. I gained practical knowledge of core Python concepts, including data
             types, operators, control structures, functions, and working libraries.
              In addition to strengthening my technical skills.
